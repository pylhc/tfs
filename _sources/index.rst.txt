Welcome to tfs-pandas' documentation!
=====================================

``tfs-pandas`` is a library for reading and writing capabilities for `TFS files <http://mad.web.cern.ch/mad/madx.old/Introduction/tfs.html>`_ used at `CERN <https://home.cern/>`_.

It provides an extension of the popular ``pandas`` `Dataframes`, called `TfsDataFrames` to do so, which in addition to the normal behaviour attach an `OrderedDict` of headers to the `DataFrame`.
