Welcome to tfs-pandas' documentation!
=====================================

``tfs-pandas`` is a library for reading and writing capabilities for `TFS files <http://mad.web.cern.ch/mad/madx.old/Introduction/tfs.html>`_ used at `CERN <https://home.cern/>`_.

To handle the format, it provides an extension of the popular **pandas** ``DataFrame`` called ``TfsDataFrame``, which in addition to the normal behaviour attach a dictionary of headers to the ``DataFrame``.
Functions are also exported that handle reading and writing of **TFS** files to and from ``TfsDataFrames``.
